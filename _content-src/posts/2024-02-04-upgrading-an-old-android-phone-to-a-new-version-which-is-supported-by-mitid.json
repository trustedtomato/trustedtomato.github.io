Not really.\nHowever, installing a newer Android _based_ distribution might very well be possible.\nAnd it's definitely worth a shot if the alternative is trashing your phone. Let's rock!\n\n## Check LineageOS support\n\nI decided to install LineageOS, since it supports a lot of devices. Although it did not have official support for my device (you can check official support here: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/), I did find an unofficial LineageOS image on a website which looked reasonably trustworthy.\nIf you can't find an image for your specific device on some part of the internet, then I have no clue how you should proceed.\nIf you did find something, move on to...\n\n## Unlocking your phone's bootloader\n\nUnlocking your bootloader enables you to flash custom ROMs, kernels, etc. onto your phone.\n*Note that this step will probably ruin your phone's warranty, so do it with caution.*\nTo find instructions for your phone, just search for \"unlocking [insert name of your device here] bootloader\" on Google.\n\n## Booting into TWRP\n\nMake sure you have your phone connected to a computer, and make sure you have adb installed on your computer.\nBoot into your device, and enable Developer Settings.\nRun `adb reboot bootloader`.\nRun `fastboot devices` (you might need sudo before the command).\n\nDownload TWRP onto your computer, cd into the download directory, then run\n`fastboot boot twrpname.img`.\n\nNow you'll be in the TWRP app. First, \"Wipe\" everything you have on the device (note that this will destroy all your data, but hopefully at this point that's fine).\nI also needed to format the file system and remove encryption. You might want to try installing without removing encryption first, since a lot of people don't seem to need this step, and removing encryption is not nice. (Without removing encryption, I got a blank screen on install, and without formatting, I got an infinite boot cycle.)\nThen you'll have to run `adb push the-path-to-lineageos-on-your-pc.img /storage/` to transfer the LineageOS image to your phone. \nThen you'll need tap \"Install\" on TWRP's main screen, select the LineageOS image, and run the install. \nIf you want Google apps (which makes sense if, for example, you need your banking stuff from Google Play), you'll need to perform the previous two steps, but with the given zip file.\nYou can find the instructions here: https://mindthegapps.com/download/\n\nAfter install, make sure to wipe the cache partitions again. Then reboot, and enjoy your OS:)\n\n## \"The device appears to be rooted\"\n\nYou wanna install some app, but you see this. Install Magisk, and follow the advice of internet people.\n\n## MitID\n\nMitID required some extra steps to be enabled, check this Reddit post for details:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/up098c/guidemitid_p%C3%A5_android_med_rootmagisk/",
