title: Finished setuping my blog
---

I've just finished setuping my blog (which you are reading right now).
I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a base; its an amazing project, if you want to build a blog, definietly check it out!
