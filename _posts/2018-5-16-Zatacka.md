summary: I've finished the web (JavaScript) version of Zatacka and this is the case study.

Zatacka is a multiplayer game played generally on one computer.
You can view it's source on [Github](https://github.com/trustedtomato/zatacka) and
play the game [on the website](https://trustedtomato.github.io/zatacka/).

But what's more interesting from a techinal perspective is that how I got there _(strong JavaScript warning)_.

Firstly I finished a version where I based all my knowledge on the actual pixels of the canvas.
I called [getImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/getImageData) for the entire canvas because calling it is very costy.
That means creating a Uint8ClampedArray with the size of
`boardWidth * boardHeight * 4` (4: red, green, blue, alpha) bytes which is around 3.4MiB for my normal sized (654x1366) screen.
If I make an array that big at every 16ms (60fps) then that fills in my 4GiB memory in 19 seconds _(note: there is no way to reuse the buffer)_.
This time is similar at different screen and memory sizes, and is definitely not good.
The forced garbage collecting introduces way too big lags.

So next I tried many small getImageData calls. Six 10x10 getImageData call is around 15ms (at this point I have to mention that my laptop is low-end with its i3-3217U processor; if I have no performance problem, not many will have).
JavaScript's performance is not really consistent, so occasionally it still had a little lag.

Okay, then I shouldn't use getImageData. I'll maintain the image data myself and
then paint it with [putImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/putImageData). Well, putImageData turned out to be way more expensive.

My final attempt was to maintain the canvas and a different array with all the needed data,
so I don't have to call get/putImageData at all.
Out of 2940 frames, 11 frames were above 1ms, and they were
<code class="block">

with completely incoherent indicies.

That's a freakingly good performance.
