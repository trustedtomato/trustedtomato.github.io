summary: I created a mashup from Who Let The Dogs Out and The Other Side Of Paradise.

The _who_ or _woof_ is very similar in
[Who Let The Dogs Out by Baha Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkuu0Lwb5EM) and [The Other Side Of Paradise by Glass Animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R0AUyvNc4Y). Sooo I mashed-up their intro where there is a lot of woof: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTkGmwqQ3cA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTkGmwqQ3cA).
